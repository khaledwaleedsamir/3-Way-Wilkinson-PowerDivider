# 3-Way-Wilkinson-PowerDivider
In this project, we designed a three-way equal power splitter at frequency 2.4 GHz, to achieve acceptable input and output ports matching, isolation between ports and equal power division ratio, Advanced Design System (ADS) is used for simulating the proposed circuit schematic, and creating the layout for the proposed schematic and doing the EM simulation.
